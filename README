Included Files:
    > Makefile
        ->  The make file provided in class for building projects for the
            Arduino.

    > README
        -> This file that you are reading...

    > Class Files
        * actor.(h/cpp)
        ->  The base actor object used to make pacMan and Ghosts. Contains
            information about the objects postion and basic function for
            manipulating the object.

        * BFS.(h/cpp)
        ->  Contains function for Bread-first Search. Is used by the ghosts to
            to path find to pacman. Implementation based on using a 2d matrix
            graph, where the cardinal direction with walkable tiles are edges.

        * controller.(h/cpp)
        ->  Used for reading the current inputs from the joystick, and button.

        * game.(h/cpp)
        ->  Tracks and manipulates important game information including score
            and lives.

        * ghost.(h/cpp)
        ->  An object that will track pacman. The speed, and error rate of
            this object can be adjusted.
        ->  Uses Bread-first Search to find the fastest path to pacman. Error
            rate will affect whether the ghost will follow this optimal path 
            or not.

        * global.(h/cpp)
        ->  Used for instantiating globally used objects such as the game, map
            and controller.

        * pacMan.(h/cpp)
        ->  Our hero, an object that can be manipulated by the player using the
            joystick.
        ->  Can eat the pellets in the maze to increase the game score, eating
            the large pellets will make pacman powerful and will allow him to
            eat the ghosts.
        ->  Getting hit by a ghost that pacman is not powerful to will result 
            in losing a life.

    > Source File
        * main.cpp
        ->  All the objects in the game are used and ran here.
        ->  Controls all the core game locic:
            ->  Where to send object after different events such as eating a 
                ghost, or losing a life.
            ->  Taking the objects position and calculating where to draw them.
            ->  Updating information that is important to the player including
                lives, and score.


    > Include Files
        * cleanMap.h
        ->  Contains the data for a clean/unused map.

        * gameConfig.h
        ->  Configuration for basic game information including map information,
            colors, and input sensitivity.

        * linked_list.h
        ->  Was given in class earlier this semester. Used for our
            implementation of Bread-first Search.
        
        * mapData.h
        ->  Contains information on the map that is actively being used. This
            map may be modified by any object as it is defined globally.

        * PDQ_ILI9341_config.h
        ->  Configuration for using the PDQ Libraries with the TFT display

        * pinout.h
        ->  Definitions for pins being used

        * shared.h
        ->  Contains all of the drawing logic. Drawing request are made to 
            shared where it will draw the request to the display.

    > Libraries
        * Arduino.h
        -> Needed for all Arduino projects
        
        * SPI.h
        ->  Used for spi communication with the tft display
        
        * PDQ_GFX.h
        ->  An optimized fork of the Adafruit GFX Libraries, allows for drawing
            to the tft display.
        
        * PDQ_ILI9341.h
        ->  An optimized fork of the Adafruit ILI9341 Libraries, needed for
            using the ILI9341 display.
    
    * Additional information on each of the class/source/include files can
      be found as comments documenting the functions/objects and their usage
      directly in each file. 

Accessories:
    * Arduino Mega Board (Other boards may work with reconfigured pins)
    * USB cable (For power and upload)
    * Wires and breadboard (For connecting everything)
    * Adafruit ILI9341 Touchscreen Display (Touchscreen not used)
    * Joystick

Notes and Assumptions:
    * The Accessories the user uses do not need any additional components such
      as resistor to limit current flow to different components.

Wiring Instructions:

    TFT Display:
       _Display Pin_   _Arduino Mega Pin_
        GND             BB GND bus
        Vin             BB Vcc (+ive) bus
        CLK             Pin 52
        MISO            Pin 50
        MOSI            Pin 51
        CS              Pin 10
        D/C             Pin 9
        CCS             Pin 6

    Joystick connections:
       _Joystick Pin_  _Arduino Mega Pin_
        +5v             Vcc
        GND             GND
        VRx             Analog 1
        VRy             Analog 0
        SW              Pin 8

Running Instructions:
    From the CMPUT 274 virtual machine that has been provided, use make to
    build the arduino project. With an arduino connected, use make upload to 
    upload the program onto the arduino.

    Once the program is flashed onto the arduino you will only need to connect
    power to the arduino in order to run the program. The computer is no longer
    needed.

    The game will start shortly after being powered on. You control pacman
    the yellow square in the centre near the bottom of the map. Move the
    joystick to change the direction that pacman is moving in. Collecting
    pellets will increase your score. Getting touched by ghosts will decrease
    your lives - unless the ghost is blinking blue, in which case you will eat
    the ghost and it will be sent back to the middle. To make the ghost blink
    blue you must eat a power pellet (the larger pellet)

    linked_list.h was given in class earlier this semester. We used it in an
    implementation of a BFS algorithm for the ghost path finding behavior.

    Some joystick code was reused
