Final Project: Pac-Man Arduino
-----------------------------------------------------------
Included Files:
    * Makefile
    * README

Accessories:
    * Arduino Mega Board
    * Breadboard
    * USB cable
    * Wires with pin connectors
    * Adafruit ILI9341 Touchscreen Display 
      (with SD card containing yeg pictures)
    * Joystick

Notes and Assumptions:
    <Put program overview here.>

Wiring Instructions:
    <Just left as default wiring in class WITHOUT touch pins.>
    <We could add touch pins or use joystick click for pause toggle?>

    TFT Display:

        The display pins are numbered left to right in this document when they 
        are being viewed with their labels showing rightside up. Note you do 
        not require the touchscreen for this assignment, so it is probably a 
        lot easier to not wire the Y+/X+/Y-/X- pins.

        Display Pin     Arduino Mega Pin
        1 GND           BB GND bus
        2 Vin           BB Vcc (+ive) bus

        4 CLK           Pin 52
        5 MISO          Pin 50
        6 MOSI          Pin 51
        7 CS            Pin 10
        8 D/C           Pin 9

        19 CCS          Pin 6

    Zoom in and out buttons:

        Button          Arduino Mega Pin
        Zoom In         Pin 2
        Zoom Out        Pin 3

    Joystick connections:

        Joystick Pin    Arduino Mega Pin
