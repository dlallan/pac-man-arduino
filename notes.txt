Remaining Tasks
    Controls
        - Joystick controls
            - Main game
            - Start menu
            - Pause menu [DONE]
            - Game Over goes back to Start menu 

    Graphics
        - Start menu
        - Pause menu (stop timer, wait for joystick click)
        - Game Over message w/ score
        - animations for pac-man
            - Draw a yellow circle
        - animations for ghosts
            - Draw colored squares
            - ghosts turn blue when pac-man eats power pellet
        - erase trail
    
    Pac-Man movement
        - 4 orientations
        - constant speed (can't stop unless at wall)
        - get current tile from center of pac-man

    Ghost movement
        - A* or Dijkstra
        - Ghost house at start 
            - 3 inside, 1 (red) outside
            - time release or points-based release mechanism?
        - Each ghost uses pathfinding algorithm to determine next tile
        - use simplified graph from website
        - see http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior
          for details.
        - Cannot reverse direction unless switching between modes
        - use Level 1 phases on website
        - Scatter mode
            - fixed "home" tile for each ghost OFFSCREEN (see image in link)
            - each ghost uses their own pathfinding AI to reach home
                - results in loop behavior in four corners
        - Chase mode (in order of exiting ghost house)
            - Red (outside initially)
                - target tile: Pac-Man's current tile
            - Pink
                - exits immediately
                - target tile: 4 tiles ahead of Pac-man 
            - Blue
                - exits after >= 30 dots consumed
                - target tile: see website
            - Orange
                - exits after >= 1/3 dots are consumed
                - Use Red targeting if distance from Pac-Man > 8 tiles
                - Use Scatter mode targeting if distance from Pac-man <= 8 tiles

        - Frightened mode
            - at an intersection, pseudorandomly decide next turn
